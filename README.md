# responsive-portfolio



The over view of this assignment was to create a professional portfolio that would be responsive to all media sizes. Primarily from desktop-sized screen, to ipad-sized screen, to a mobile device screen. 

The languages I used in this project are HTML, CSS, along with BootStrap.

 

 To make your own responsive portfolio heres how:

 create a repository include read.me

 clone repository 

 open repository on vs code


create html links

create the head of your code for each html


add navbar using bootstrap css styling of your choice as long as it is responsive which 
bootstrap usually takes care of

include other css styling from bootstrap of your choosing in each of your html's

source images through html

include media queries to ensure responsiveness on all devices

check code for spelling errors or typos in code. 

add the code to your local by using git add .

commit your code using git commit -m ""

push using git push
